		Track This Page -
		You can add the code below to any laravel blade file to automatically
		track that page. Just pass the page ID as a parameter and you're good.

		Optionally, you can also directly call this function in a Controller
		or directly in a routes file. If you're feeling brave, you can make
		your own middleware as well.
